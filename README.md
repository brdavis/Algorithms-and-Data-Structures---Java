# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures---Java
Copyright (c) 2017 Blair Davis

This Github repository acts primarily as a sandbox to hold all of my files pertaining to algorithms and data structures implemented in Java. While Java doesn't necessarily lend itself to such programming in the way that other programming languages might, algorithms and data structures can be written in any language. This repository has the dual purpose of holding my practice files and providing reference files for others interested in learning or refreshing their computer science foundation. A complete list of all intended algorithms is shown below.  

**Algorithms:**  

**Graphs**
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Depth First Search (DF)

**Searching**
* Sequential Search
* Linear Search
* Binary Search

** Sorting**
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort

As an explicit clarification, all programs in this repository are written in Java and intended to be deployed via the linux command line.
